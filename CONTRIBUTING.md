# Contributing guides

## Creating Issues

### 1. Search for Existing Issues

Before creating a new issue, search the issue tracker to check if a similar issue already exists. If you find a relevant issue, feel free to comment and provide additional information or insights.

### 2. Be Descriptive

When creating an issue, provide a clear and concise title that describes the problem or feature request. In the issue description:

* Include steps to reproduce a bug.
* Describe the expected behavior.
* Specify the actual behavior you observed.
* Mention any error messages or log outputs.
* If suggesting a new feature, explain its purpose and potential benefits.
* You can also use the templates provided when you click on `New issue`.

### 3. Use Labels

Assign appropriate labels to your issue to help categorize and prioritize it. Labels may include "bug," "feature," "documentation," and others relevant to your project.

## Creating Pull Requests (PRs)

### 1. Fork the Repository

To contribute code, fork the repository to your GitHub account. Create a new branch for your changes, ensuring it has a descriptive name (e.g., `feature/add-new-feature` or `bugfix/fix-issue-123`).

### 2. Keep Your Fork Updated

Regularly sync your fork with the main repository to incorporate any changes. You can do this using Git commands or the "Sync" button on GitHub.

### 3. Work on Isolated Branches

For each feature, bug fix, or improvement, create a separate branch. This makes it easier to manage and review your changes.

### 4. Follow Coding Standards

Adhere to the project's coding standards and style guidelines. If there are specific conventions or formatting rules, make sure your code complies with them.

### 5. Write Good Commit Messages

Each commit message should be concise and describe the purpose of the commit. Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Fix bug" rather than "Fixed bug").

### 6. Provide a Clear Description

When creating a PR, include a clear and comprehensive description of your changes. Explain why the changes are necessary and how they address the issue or improve the project.

### 7. Reference Issues

If your PR relates to a specific issue, reference it by including "Fixes #issue-number" or "Closes #issue-number" in the PR description. This automatically links the PR to the issue and helps with issue tracking.

### 8. Keep PRs Focused

Keep PRs focused on a single, well-defined task or feature. If you have multiple changes to propose, create separate PRs for each.

### 10. Be Patient and Responsive

Maintainers and reviewers may take some time to review your PR. Be patient and responsive to their feedback and requests for changes.
